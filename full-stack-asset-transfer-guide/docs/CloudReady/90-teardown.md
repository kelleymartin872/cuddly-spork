# Teardown

## Conga Test 

## Final Exercise: Build Your (Social) Network 

- Write down your email address / linkedin profile / # discord handle / etc. on the back of your Conga Card.
- Use the fabric-ca-client to enroll the user / password listed on your Conga Card.
- `create()` an NFT asset for your Conga Card on the shared workshop blockchain.
- Go around the room and meet people attending the workshop.
- Exchange your Conga Cards with workshop participants, issuing a `transfer()` transaction on the shared ledger.  
- When you exchange conga cards, record the new owners (both on the back of the card and the ledger!)
- Bring your Conga Trading Cards home, and reach out to all your new friends and colleagues.
